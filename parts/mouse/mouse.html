    <h1>Mouse</h1>
    <h4>This article is about the item of computer hardware. For the pointer or cursor it controls, see <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(user_interface)">Pointer (user interface)</a>.</h4><br><br>
	<p>
		A computer mouse (plural mice, sometimes mouses) is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion<br>
		relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a<br>
		smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.<br>
		Mice originally used two separate wheels to track movement across a surface; one in the X-dimension and one in the Y.<br>
		Later, the standard design shifted to utilize a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion.<br>
		Most modern mice use optical sensors that have no moving parts.<br>
		Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable, some modern mice are cordless,<br>
		relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.<br>

	<p>
		In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as the selection of<br>
		a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and scroll wheels,<br>
		which enable additional control and dimensional input.<br>
