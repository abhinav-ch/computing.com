    <h1>Monitor</h1>
    <p>
      A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial or text form.<br>
      A monitor usually comprises a visual display, some circuitry, a casing, and a power supply.<br>
      The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED<br>
      backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting.<br>
      Previous monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT) and some Plasma (also called Gas-Plasma) displays.<br>
      Monitors are connected to the computer via VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C,<br>
      low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television sets were used for entertainment.<br>
      From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment,<br>
      while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The common aspect ratio of televisions, and computer<br>
      monitors, has changed from 4:3 to 16:10, to 16:9.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets and vice versa.<br>
      However, as computer monitors do not necessarily include integrated speakers nor<br>
      TV tuners (such as digital television adapters), it may not be possible to use a computer monitor as a TV<br>
      set without external components.<br>
