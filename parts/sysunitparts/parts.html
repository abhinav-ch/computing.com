    <h1>Components of the System Unit</h1>
    <b><p>
    	Some of the components in the <a href="../../parts/sysunit/sysunit.html">System Unit</a> are; random access memory (RAM), compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), hard disk, motherboard, fan, processor or central processing unit (CPU), power supply, and floppy disk drive.
		<br><br>
		The system unit also has other components, such as a universal serial bus (USB) port, power button, cables, video, and sound card.
		<br><br>
		Then, let's get more information about the main components of system unit.
    </p></b>
	<h2>Parts of the System Unit:</h2>
	<ul>
		<b>
		<li><h3>1. Motherboard</h3>
		<p>
			The motherboard is the main internal hardware component of the system unit.<br>
			This board is called the "motherboard" because it has all the connectors that connect to the other hardware<br>
			components of the computer system. This means that all input and output (I/O) devices have their connectors<br>
			on the motherboard.<br>
			<br>
			<img src="../../wares/hard/motherboard.png" alt="Motherboard">
			<br>
			Since the CPU (especially high-speed CPU) generates a lot of heat during operation, it has a socket for fixing<br>
			the central processing unit (CPU) or the processor with a heat sink and fan. It also has a main memory slot,<br>
			a video or graphics card slot, and a backup battery.<br>
		</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><h3>2. CPU or Processor</h3>
		<p>
			The CPU is the hardware component responsible for all operations performed in the computer system,<br>
			which is why most computer users call it the brain of the computer, which is fixed on the<br>
			motherboard through a slot.<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://www.techguide.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intel8th1.jpg" alt="Comouter Proccessor" style="width: 550px;height: 500px;">
			<br>
			The CPU or processor has two main components, namely the control unit (CU) and the arithmetic logic<br>
			unit (ALU). CU fetches instructions from memory and executes them to control input and output<br>
			devices, while ALU performs arithmetic and logic processing. The speed of the processor is<br>
			measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).<br>
		</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><h3>3. RAM(Random access Memory)</h3>
		<p>
			RAM is the main memory of a computer system, and its main function is to temporarily store data.<br>
			Based on the fact that the data is accessed randomly (in no particular order), it allows the CPU to easily<br>
			access the data. It can also speed up the operation of the computer because it allows random access to data.<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://5.imimg.com/data5/DU/LC/MY-46053832/original-ddr2-2gb-random-access-memory-500x500.jpg" alt="RAM">
			<br>
			The larger the RAM, the faster the CPU can access data. RAM is volatile, which means it works or stores data<br>
			while the computer is still running, and loses all data when the computer is shut down. RAM, CPU, and hard disk<br>
			are the main sources of computer speed. A computer can use multiple RAMs, depending on the user's preference,<br>
			but limited by the number of memory slots on the motherboard.<br>
		</p></li>
		<br>
		<li><h3>4. Hard Disk</h3>
		<p>
			The main storage device of a computer system is a hard disk or hard disk drive. Unlike RAM, which temporarily stores<br>
			data, the main function of a hard drive is to permanently store information, files, and other documents, and also<br>
			allows data to be retrieved, but it is non-volatile (data will not be lost when the computer is shut down).<br>
			<br>
			The operating system and application software (apps) are installed on the hard drive.<br>
			The amount of data that a hard drive can hold depends on its capacity.<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://www.easyshoppi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WD-RED-4TB-NAS-HARD-DISK-DRIVE-_WD40EFRX__3.png" alt="Hard Disk" style="width: 500px;height: 500px;">
			<br>
			Most modern system units or chassis can contain two hard drives, one of which can be used as a "primary" (primary)<br>
			hard drive; one for installing the operating system, and the other as a "slave" (secondary) hard drive;<br>
			you can combine documents and Other files are stored on which files and other files to avoid overloading the main<br>
			hard drive to avoid slowing down the system. The secondary hard drive can also be used as a backup for damage to<br>
			the primary hard drive.<br>
		</p></li>
		<br><br><br>
		There are more components in the system unit which are on the motherboard like ROM(Read only Memory), Fan(this cools down the inner of the computer. If the computer heats up a lot, it can explode or get spoilt.), Graphics card(controls graphics), GPU(graphics proccessing unit) etc.
