    <h1>Hardware</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      Abbreviated as HW, hardware is best described as any physical component of a computer system containing<br>
      a circuit board, ICs, or other electronics. A perfect example of hardware is the screen on which<br>
      you are viewing this page. Whether it be a monitor, tablet, or smartphone, it is hardware.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Without any hardware, your computer would not exist, and software could not be used.<br>
      The picture is a Logitech webcam, an example of an external hardware peripheral.<br>
      This hardware device allows users to take videos or pictures, and transmit them over the Internet.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>External Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      External Hardware is the hardware that's installed outside of the computer.<br>
      For example, a printer (shown in picture) is an external device because it connects to the back of the computer and is outside the case.<br>
      However, a video card is an internal device since it is found inside of the computer case.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of external hardware</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Speakers</li>
      <li>Joy Stick</li>
      <li>Mouse</li>
      <li>Keyboard</li>
      <li>Printer</li>
      <li>Monitor</li>
      <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Internal Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      Internal Hardware is the hardware that's installed inside of the computer.<br>
      For example, Mother Board (shown in picture) is an internal device because it connects on the inside of the system unit of the computer and is inside the case.<br>
      However, a Printer is an external device since it is found outside of the computer case.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of Internal Hardware</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CPU</li>
      <li>Mother Board</li>
      <li>Hard Disk</li>
      <li>RAM</li>
      <li>etc</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Internal and External Hardwares are both important for the Computer to work.<br>
      You need the keyboard to type something and the mouse to interact with the screen.<br>
      You need internal hardware to run the os and store data in the hard Disk.<br>
