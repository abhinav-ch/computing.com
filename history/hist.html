    <h1>History Of Computers</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>
      The first counting device was used by the primitive people.<br>
      They used sticks, stones and bones as counting tools.<br>
      As human mind and technology improved with time more computing devices were developed.<br>
      Some of the popular computing devices starting with the first to recent ones are described below;
    </p>

    <h2>Abacus</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      The history of computer begins with the birth of abacus which is believed to be the first computer.<br>
      It is said that Chinese invented Abacus around 4,000 years ago.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      It was a wooden rack which has metal rods with beads mounted on them.<br>
      The beads were moved by the abacus operator according to some rules to perform arithmetic calculations.<br>
      Abacus is still used in some countries like China, Russia and Japan.<br>
      An image of this tool is shown below;<br>

      <br><br><br>
      <h2>Napier's Bones</h2>
      <p>
        It was a manually-operated calculating device which was invented by John Napier (1550-1617) of Merchiston.<br>
        In this calculating tool, he used 9 different ivory strips or bones marked with numbers to multiply and divide.<br>
        So, the tool became known as "Napier's Bones.<br>
        It was also the first machine to use the decimal point.<br>

      <h2>Pascaline</h2>
      <p>
        Pascaline is also known as Arithmetic Machine or Adding Machine.<br>
        It was invented between 1642 and 1644 by a French mathematician-philosopher Biaise Pascal.<br>
        It is believed that it was the first mechanical and automatic calculator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pascal invented this machine to help his father, a tax accountant.<br>
        It could only perform addition and subtraction.<br>
        It was a wooden box with a series of gears and wheels.<br>
        When a wheel is rotated one revolution, it rotates the neighboring wheel.<br>
        A series of windows is given on the top of the wheels to read the totals.<br>

      <h1>Generations of Computers</h1>
      <p>
        A generation of computers refers to the specific improvements in computer technology with time.<br>
        In 1946, electronic pathways called circuits were developed to perform the counting.<br>
        It replaced the gears and other mechanical parts used for counting in previous computing machines.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        In each new generation, the circuits became smaller and more advanced than the previous generation circuits.<br>
        The miniaturization helped increase the speed, memory and power of computers.<br>
        There are five generations of computers which are described below;<br>
      </p>

      <h2>First Generation Computers</h2>
      <p>
        The first generation (1946-1959) computers were slow, huge and expensive.<br>
        In these computers, vacuum tubes were used as the basic components of CPU and memory.<br>
        These computers were mainly depended on batch operating system and punch cards.<br>
        Magnetic tape and paper tape were used as output and input devices in this generation;<br>
      </p>

      <h3>Some of the popular first generation computers are:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>ENIAC ( Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)</li>
          <li>EDVAC ( Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)</li>
          <li>UNIVACI( Universal Automatic Computer)</li>
          <li>IBM-701</li>
          <li>IBM-650</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Second Generation Computers</h2>

      <p>
        The second generation (1959-1965) was the era of the transistor computers.<br>
        These computers used transistors which were cheap, compact and consuming less power;<br>
        it made transistor computers faster than the first generation computers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the<br>
        primary memory and magnetic disc and tapes were used as the secondary storage.<br>
        language and programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN, and Batch processing<br>
        and multiprogramming operating systems were used in these computers.
      </p>

      <h2>Some of the popular second generation computers are;</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>IBM 1620</li>

        <li>CDC 3600</li>
        <li>UNIVAC 1108</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third Generation Computers</h2>

      <p>
        The third generation computers used integrated circuits (ICs) instead of transistors.<br>
        A single IC can pack huge number of transistors which increased the power of a computer and reduced the cost.<br>
        The computers also became more reliable, efficient and smaller in size.<br>
        These generation computers used remote processing, time-sharing, multi programming as operating system.<br>
        Also, the high-level programming languages like FORTRON-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, ALGOL-68 were used in this generation.<br>
      </p>

      <h2>Some of the popular third generation computers are;</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>IBM-360 series</li>
        <li>Honeywell-6000 series</li>
        <li>PDP(Personal Data Processor)</li>
        <li>IBM-370/168</li>
        <li>TDC-316</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fourth Generation Computers</h2>
      <p>
        The fourth generation (1971-1980) computers used very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits;<br>
        a chip containing millions of transistors and other circuit elements.<br>
        These chips made this generation computers more compact, powerful, fast and affordable.<br>
        These generation computers used real time, time sharing and distributed operating system.<br>
        The programming languages like C, C++, DBASE were also used in this generation.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Some of the popular fourth generation computers are;</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>DEC 10</li>

        <li>CRAY-X-MP(Super Computer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fifth Generation Computers</h2>
      <p>
        In fifth generation (1980-till date) computers, the VLSI technology was replaced with ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration).<br>
        It made possible the production of microprocessor chips with ten million electronic components.<br>
        This generation computers used parallel processing hardware and AI (Artificial Intelligence) software.<br>
        The programming languages used in this generation were C, C++, Java, .Net, etc.<br>
